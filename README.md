# üß† AI Journal ‚Äì Daily Thought Tracker & Mood Analyzer

AI Journal is a full-stack journaling web application that allows users to write and save their daily thoughts. Each entry is analyzed using the OpenAI API to automatically generate a brief summary or detect the user's mood. Journal entries are securely stored in a Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL) database and presented in a clean, timeline-style layout so users can reflect on their past writing.

Using v0.dev, I quickly scaffolded the UI and built functional components, which significantly sped up full-stack development. The application demonstrates how easily modern AI tooling can be integrated into a project to provide insightful, real-time feedback on user entries.
